# - Setup documentation
#
# Assumes that a Doxyfile template is located in the project root
# directory, and that all documentation is going to be generated
# into its own Documentation/ directory. It will also generate an
# installation target for the documentation (not built by default)
#
# Requires the following suffices to be set:
# _NAME                Name of the project
#
# Output the following suffices:
# _STYLESHEET_COPIED   Location of stylesheet to be removed in distclean
